# Ripsaw #

This is a tool that is (at the moment) just OcculterCut with some bug fixes. 
Perhaps one day it will grow into something that can stand on its own, who knows?

### How do I get set up? ###

Installation/compilation is 
- Clone the repository
- `go build .`

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
Yeah, I'll get to that eventually. At the moment the project is too simple, 
but that might change.

### Who do I talk to? ###

Any questions - talk to me - rob.syme@curtin.edu.au
